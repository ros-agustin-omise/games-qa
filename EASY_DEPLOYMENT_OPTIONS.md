## 🎯 **My Recommendation: Try Netlify First**

**Why Netlify?**
- No configuration needed
- Works immediately 
- Free forever
- Professional URLs
- Auto-updates from GitHub

**Quick Start:**
1. Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag your `games-qa` folder to the deploy area
3. **Your Playverse is live in 30 seconds!**

## 🔧 **If You Still Want GitHub Pages:**

The issue might be:
- Repository not public
- Missing admin permissions
- Wrong branch settings

**Quick fix attempt:**
```bash
# Try manual gh-pages deployment
npm run deploy

# Then in GitHub Settings → Pages:
# Source: "Deploy from a branch"
# Branch: "gh-pages"
```

## 📱 **Testing Your Live Site**

Once deployed with any method:
1. Test all 6 games work
2. Check navigation between games
3. Verify leaderboards save data
4. Test on mobile devices

**Your games should all work perfectly on any of these platforms!** 🎮✨
